## Quick Start

Upon running the RetroEditorApplication, you will currently be presented with a blank screen and a menu bar.

The first thing to do is create a project, File->Create New Project.

From here, click on __Choose Game__ and select a supported game image. see _under construction_

Alter the project name if you wish, then click on __Create Project__.

After a short while (the libretro plugin to support the game needs to be downloaded), and the emulator should show the game.

At this point the Window menu should have a new item (name of the project with a [1] appended to it), and this should expand
to allow selection of various aspects to edit on the chosen game.
